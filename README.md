# Katas

## What I attempted.
In this attempt, i wanted to attempt to use both TDD and the Transformation Priority Principal to undertake the 
Roman Numerals Kata.

## What I learned.
What i learned from this attempt is that i have a lot of work on TDD to do! More appopriately I feel that I started 
well, i let the tests drive the behaviour. Then i found that i was stuck and that i couldnt find the way to 
stop the unending if else statments. This is when i realised that i wasnt using the principal properly.
In the next attenpt i will stick to the principal more rigidly and take inspiration from a blog post i found.
I shall document it fully in the next readme.
